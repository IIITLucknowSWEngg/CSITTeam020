# Software Design Description (SDD)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Software Design Description (SDD) is to provide a comprehensive design for the OYO room booking platform. This document describes the system's architecture, components, interfaces, and workflows to ensure seamless integration of functionality and scalability for the platformâ€™s users, which include customers, service providers, and administrators.

### 1.2 Scope

The OYO platform enables customers to book accommodations such as hotels, homes, and vacation rentals. Service providers can list and manage their properties. The platform includes mobile and web applications for customers and providers, backend API services, payment processing, real-time communication, and integration with third-party services like maps and payment gateways.

## 2. System Overview

The OYO system comprises three main components:

- **Customer Interface** (Mobile/Web App for Customers)
- **Service Provider Interface** (Mobile/Web App for Property Managers)
- **Backend System** (API, Business Logic, and Database Management)

The system operates across Android, iOS, and web platforms, supported by a scalable, cloud-hosted backend infrastructure.
